# Shiny App of To Do List
This Repo contains an example of a shiny app that accesses a shared Google Sheet to create a timeline plot of a To-Do List. 

The running example App is deployed at my [shinyapps.io page](https://peter-t-ruehr.shinyapps.io/to-do-list/).

The underlying Google Sheet can be viewed (but not changed) [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HxKdDuA7pt1r-LGCbkwBYxr4jZ2Tvwq2GBRBf3skKho/).

Here is a screenshot of the App:

So far, I have not added any documentation, so basic knowledge on R and Shiny Apps is required. The App makes heavy use of the [vistime package(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vistime/vignettes/vistime-vignette.html#usage-in-shiny-apps).

Have fun with it, and drop me a message _via_ the [issues page](https://github.com/Peter-T-Ruehr/To-Do-List-in-R-example/issues) in case you run into problems.
